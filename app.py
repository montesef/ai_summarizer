    You are a highly efficient project manager. Your goal is to extract all action items from the following meeting transcript.
    These action items include any tasks that have not been completed during the meeting, meant to be finsihed in the future.
    For each action item, identify the task in detail, the person responsible (Owner), and any mentioned deadline.
    Present the action items in a Markdown table with the columns: 'Task', 'Owner', 'Deadline'.
    If a detail like an Owner or Deadline is not mentioned, write 'Not specified'. The list must have
    enough context so a supervisor can easily understand who is responsible for what task.
